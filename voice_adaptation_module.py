    Yeah, yeah. But there's also a text grad part that we can take like just that structured prompt, like the input for 
    prompt and then that will change the prompt. So we can change the prompt level, actual like value in the JSON. But 
    then DSPY is adding information for the model to use. There's a few different levels of what's happening.
    
    Cameron Barre - 00:35
    All the stuff that DSPY is adding. Is it durable? If you were to turn off the service and restart it has the same access 
    to the same information to add.
    
    Daryl Roberts - 00:45
    Yeah. After it does its training and everything, it just outputs all the new information to a JSON and then the model 
    just pulls from that JSON. As long as that JSON, nothing happens to it. It's there even if it's not there, it'll just say 
    using default node or whatever. Yeah, it's pretty nuts. It's also doing bootstrap view shot at the top of it's looking at 
    all of the training data and choosing which examples give us the best outputs.
    
    Justin Obney - 01:45
    So this is all dope. What I, what I, what will be so awesome for me is ways that I can visualize and communicate this 
    to like people of say. Because when I think of like our push of saying there's all these other layers to like the 
    engineering pieces and I kind of see this world where the frst part is. It's like a simple visualization of the agent
